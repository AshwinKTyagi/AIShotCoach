## Current Ideas

I want to take in real videos to build a prediction on whether a basketball shot goes in based on a player's shotform.
The goal is to have a resulting program that can be used as a tool to create a consistent shotform. 
Task list is not comprehensive and gives a skeleton of my workflow.


Tasks:
- ~~Set up MediaPipe to handle inputting videos~~
- Convert MediaPipe landmarkers into comprehensible np arrays for input into neural network: WIP
- Gather data: WIP
- Build and train neural network
- Create frontend for input training videos
- Create frontend for general use
